# Title:-Emperical Study of Random Projection
   Random Projection is a dimensionality reduction algorithm based on the JL-Lemma Principle. here the distance between any two sample points in the original dimension and in the projected dimension is near about is constant with some error. This dimensionality algorithm works best when applied on a large dataset having a large dimension. In this project series of experiments is performed to study the properties and results of random projection.
